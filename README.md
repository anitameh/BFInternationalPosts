BFInternationalPosts
====================

In this visualization, we study the path of an international BuzzFeed post. 

Some things to note:
* __Area__ of the bubbles' circles are proportional to the total number of pageviews. This is important because a circle is drawn in D3 as a function of (naturally) the radius, which can be counter-intuitive when playing with the viz.
* All data used for this project are aggregated at a city-level, and therefore have no PII-concerns. It is internal-BuzzFeed data and unavailable for use unless permission is granted. Please reach out to the Data Science team at BuzzFeed for more information.
